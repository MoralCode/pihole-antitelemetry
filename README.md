# pihole-antitelemetry
[Research](https://www.scss.tcd.ie/doug.leith/apple_google.pdf) shows Google collects 20x more data from Android than Apple collects from iOS. Block both using these pihole lists.


This project is currently a work-in progress. Feel free to contribute by submitting issues or pull requests.


For a list of domains that should not break anything, use `telemetry-domains.txt`. If you want to also block domains that are not well-tested, add `telemetry-domains_beta.txt` to the list. known-broken domains are moved to `telemetry-domains_borked.txt`.

Any help with testing or un-borking domains is appreceated
